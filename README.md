## Refact.ai 1.2 Release

Refact.ai is an AI coding assistant, available for Jet Brains IDEs and Visual Studio Code. In this major release, we introduce:

1. All new AI Toolbox, that allows you to operate on existing code. You can automatically make your code shorter, cleaner, fix bugs — improving your efficiency as an engineer.

2. The new Refact.ai Chat integration is ready to give you hints on APIs usage, documentation links, and much more.

3. The new Privacy Settings page lets you point out which code is OK to send to the cloud for inference, and which isn’t. This works on per project and even per file basis.

Our code completion is still fast & responsive, looks up and down from the cursor position, and works for 20+ programming languages!

In the Pro version, you can enjoy all of those AI features, integrated into a single package that follows your privacy settings.

Check out our Trial version, ready to start working for you in seconds!
