## Code Completion
As you type in code, this feature offers suggestions to increase your productivity. It can suggest commonly used programming patterns, libraries and APIs usage, and it helps with typing.

By looking up and down the cursor, it can make more informed suggestions based on surrounding code, natural language comments, and other contextual information.

It also works fast!

## You Are In Control of Your Data
We are not collecting data on server side (the inference server), see website for details.

## Open Source
The plugin is open source: you can verify for yourself it cares about your data as advertised.

## Getting Started
The sidebar on the left lets you explore new features. There is also a status icon on at the bottom of the screen, it reflects communication with AI inference server.

## Cloud Subscription
You can start with a free trial, switch to a paid subscription later. Alternatively, if you have a GPU you can run your own open source self-hosted version.

## Experimental Features
Select & Refactor: select lines to change, press F1. It will ask you for your intent: what are you trying to do? Try "add docstrings", "add type hints", "convert to list comprehension", "use lambda". The model will try to modify the selected lines only.

Highlight & Fix: press F1 without selection. The model will highlight all the places it thinks your instruction is applicable to. Click on highlighted lines to generate changes.

Stay tuned for more!
