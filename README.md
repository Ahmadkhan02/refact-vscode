## Features
- **Code Completion:** satisfying, smart and relevant code completion that can suggest whole functions or classes. It suggests commonly used programming patterns, libraries and APIs usage, and helps with typing. This helps you write code faster and with fewer errors.
- **Code Transformation:** use natural language commands to ask the AI to search, transform, or optimize your code. Whether you're looking to optimize, search, or refactor your code, Codify has you covered.
- **Privacy of your code guaranteed:** Codify allows you to restrict access to particular files or projects, ensuring that your private code or confidential files are protected. And we never store your code on the server side.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Codify has a simple, user-friendly interface that makes it easy to use, even for those new to AI tools. Codify will assist by completing your code or by accessing the AI toolbox function (use F1 to open).
- **It’s fast!** And supports Python, Java, PHP, C++, Javascript, TypeScript and 20 more programming languages.

Codify is a cutting-edge AI tool designed to assist developers in writing and refining code.
Whether you're working on a brand new project or modifying existing code, Codify can help you save time and streamline your coding process.

If you have your own NVIDIA GPU, you can try the [self-hosted version](https://codify.smallcloud.ai/docker).
Our proprietary [AI model behind](https://www.smallcloud.ai/) Codify is state-of-the-art (for the size and latency). The weights are free to [download on Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/smallcloudai).

## Crowdsourcing Human Feedback
No one likes big corporations taking over our development toolchain, right? You can improve independent code tools like this one simply by turning your privacy settings to a relaxed position for some of your projects. We’ll tune the model to better follow YOUR commands and the tool will get better for everybody!
