## Installation
1. Install the extension
2. Click through the login pop-up browser option and follow it to [codify.smallcloud.ai](https://codify.smallcloud.ai); we recommend using login with Google or GitHub to avoid email verification.

## Getting started
You can see the “codify” status on the right bottom corner of the screen. The status will be updated when codify is communicating with the server.

On the left bar, you can see the new Codify panel. It lets you explore new features and shows the history of the requests you sent to Codify.

## How to use
To ask Codify to do something, press F1. It will ask you for your intent: what are you trying to do? Try "Add docstrings" or "Add type hints". 
Change suggestions provided by the model with another press on F1.

If you want to focus on a specific area of your code, just highlight it before asking Codify.

# Features
## Select & Refactor
Ask the plugin to focus and refactor the piece of code you selected.
## Edit chaining
After your change, explore changes which naturally follow from yours. Change names, counts, refactor code in the semi-automated manner.
## Autohighlight
Automatically find and highlight pieces of code relevant to your intent.
## Autocomplete
Accept suggestions about your next lines of code based on context & syntax both before and after the cursor.
## Settings
You can access the Codify Settings panel by going to the Extensions panel in VSCode, selecting the extension, and clicking on to Extension settings.

Codify settings allow you to 
- Enter your API key
- Choose Temperature for the model. Lower temperature guides the model to select higher probability words, whereas higher temperature allows it to provide more variable suggestions.
